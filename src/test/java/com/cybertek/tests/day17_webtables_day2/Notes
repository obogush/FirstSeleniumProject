Agenda: Web Tables.

 <table>
 	<thead>
 		<th>

 		</th>
 	</thead>
 	<tbody>
 		<tr>
 			<td></td>
 		</tr>
 	</tbody>
 </table>

If we want to make sure that element doesn't exists, based on locator - use findElements(). Empty list means no such element found.But, at the same time - you will not get an exception.


"a".compareTo("x");

//table[1]//tbody//tr//td[2]

Means select data from second column.
If we don't specify index of tr, that means
we are selecting elements from all rows.
